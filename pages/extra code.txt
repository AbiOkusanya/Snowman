////////original plan 
//keydown with keyboard event provide code indicating which key ispressed
/*The static String.fromCharCode() method returns a string created from 
the specified sequence of UTF-16 code units.*/

// //need to covert the keycode from the keydownevent to a character to pass to a string
// // let whatPlayerPressed = [];    
// let character = String.fromCharCode(whatPlayerPresses);//something wrong here
//     console.log (character); //not sure if this part is working

// })
//need to check if whatPlayerPresses is correct
// if (character.indexof(playWord)> -1){
//     console.log (true);
// }
/*need to print/display the letter the player guesses whether correct or not
document.getElementbyId('correct').innerHTML = whatPlayerPresses ?*/
//need for when guess is complete and word right alert woo hoo

//need when out of guess or word wrong alert try again
//show how many turns are left?
//if time either have a melted snowman appear if answer wrong or complete snowman if right?

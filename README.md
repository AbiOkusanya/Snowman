# Snowman
Snowman game - project week

>This is my first game  – SNOWMAN 
>
>The rules of the game are as follows:
>Take turns guessing a word by a letter each turn, if you are wrong, a part of the snowman figure is added and your turns are over when the figure is complete.
>
>Design choices
>The page will start with the empty dashes representing the words (on a colored/image background). 
>Each player gets a turn, if answer is right an alert will come up (woo hoo?), if wrong alert (“Take another shot”) and below the dashes a “snowman will start to compose. 
>The dashes will fill in with the correct guessed letter and to the side the incorrect guessed letter will be displayed. Once someone wins, two alerts. First, player x wins (yeah!), >second, click here to play another round. 
>New game starts with different word (and background).

>Schedule of completion 
>Code out the html first by 12/10
>Work on CSS(figure out some basic animation to move the snowman as well) 12/11, 12/12
>Add JS 12/12 -13-14
>Work on bugs 12/15 and submit.
